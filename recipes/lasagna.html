                <li>⅓ cup soy sauce (low sodium)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ginger (freshly grated)</li>
                <li>½ cup chicken broth (low sodium)</li>
                <li>black pepper (to taste)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>

        Cook the noodles: Blanch udon noodles in boiling water for about 1 to 2 minutes or if using dry noodles cook according to package instructions. Drain well and immediately rinse with cold water. Set aside.
Make the sauce: Add all the sauce ingredients together to a bowl and whisk until combined.
Saute the sauteables: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or a wok. Add the chicken pieces and cook until chicken is no longer pink and starts to brown slightly. Add the mushrooms and cook for a couple more minutes until mushroom are starting to brown.
Finish the dish: Add the udon noodles and prepared sauce to the wok, toss everything together well and cook until the noodles are heated through. Garnish with green onions and serve hot.
